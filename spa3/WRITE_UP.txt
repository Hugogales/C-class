WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM DOING THIS LAB?

I learnt and primarily got practice using classes and creating .h files.
I enjoyed and learn a lot about header files and how they work with the .cpp files.
I got practice using #ifndef and #endif and why it is needed/usefull.
It  was also usefull using pointers.

WHAT DID I FIND CHALLENGING ABOUT THE LAB?

I found it to be generally straing foward and did not have many problems other than a small bug.
the biggest hurdle was creating header file and using #ifndef and #endif, however that did not take too long.

WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND CHANGING IF THIS LAB IS REUSED IN FUTURE YEARS?

I would recommend doing more trivial work with pointer to get more work and experience using them. 
However the focus of this lab is on classes and it was quite usefull
